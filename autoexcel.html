        My wife has to work with a lot of Excel matrices, and for each project they
        are working on, they have to apply the same transforms, formulas and operations
        to dozens of different input data. It's a very destructive workflow.
        If a mistake is done during the process, she has
        to redo multiple steps. It also prevents of trying and experimenting with
        different ways of analyzing the data, since it's quite time consuming.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's quite the same case of working on a painting in Photoshop with or without layers
        and layer filters. The former approach is very destructive and rigid, while the latter
        is safer, prevents disasters, and allows quick changes and experimentation.

        Another example would be working in Houdini with nodes vs editing the mesh directly.
        I guess you get the point.
    </p>
    <p> So for many years I tried helping her with this issue. The fact
    is that Excel is too familiar and convenient (and let's face it, an amazing piece of
    software) that is hard to find an alternative. I tried a few things:
    
    <ul>
        <li>A node-based approach (made a prototype in phyton)</li>
        <li>A very simple scripting system (in C)</li>
        <li>A stack-based approach (prototype in Javascript)</li>
    </ul>
    and I'm sure I'm forgetting a couple more.
    </p>

    <p>The latest thing I made so far is a second stack-based prototype in Javascript. It looks like this:</p>
