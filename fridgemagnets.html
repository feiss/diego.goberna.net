        I recently bought some tiny tiny neodym magnets for my <a href="woodenchess.html">hand

    <p>Well, "fridge magnets" was the most obvious answer. To quickly prototype and make, I made
        them with foam board and regular color markers.</p>

        With this idea in mind, I designed these magnets to be separate and reusable parts of animals:

        Kids had some laughts playing with them ðŸ™‚. If they keep playing for a couple days more
        I'll think of making more pieces.
