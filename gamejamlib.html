    <p>
        For the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023" target="_blank">GMTK Game Jam 2023</a>
        I remade the first level of <b>Mario Bros</b> with a twist. The theme was <b>"Roles Reversed"</b>,
        and the idea was to make the player help the enemies (by feeding them), not kill them.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can <a href="https://feiss.itch.io/farmer-pepe" target="_blank">play the cursed game at itch.io</a>.

    <p>My game got desqualified for copyright infridgement (surprise!). The fact is that
        I always thought of repainting all the sprites before submitting, but at some point getting
        close to the deadline I had to choose between delivering a playable game with full gameplay
        that would probably be desqualified or a broken game with original sprites.. and I chose the former
        <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        One very interesting thing about this mini project was to create the tiniest library I could use for
        mini game jams like this. Very lightweight, simple, for pixelart (palette-based) style.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can take a look at the
        library in the <code>src</code> folder of the <a href="https://github.com/feiss/gmtk2023"
            target="_blank">GMTK2023 repository</a>.
    </p>

    Features:
    <ul>
        <li>Pixel art style with palette indexing</li>
        <li>Basic primitive drawing: pixels, lines, circles, texts, rectangles and images</li>
        <li>Easy keyboard and mouse handling</li>
        <li>Multiple animations per spritesheet (frames, fps, custom anchor position)</li>
        <li>Math utilities: Vector, Rect</li>

    </ul>
