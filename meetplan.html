    <h1>Meetplan</h1>
    <p class="date">Dec 2, 2023</p>

    <p>
        Don't you ever want to plan something (meeting, trip, party) among multiple people,
        and is really hard to agree on a date? maybe you try using WhatsApp, but that's horrific
        if many people is involved. Ok, why don't you use an online service like.. like what?
    </p>
    <p>I don't know of any service that is free, doesn't require login and easily allows people
        announce their availability/preferences for a plan. Do you know any? I bet you don't.
    </p>
    <p>So I tried myself:</p>

    <p>You could set which days you are available the whole day, only in the morning or only in the afternoon.</p>
    <p>I didn't go much further than that. No meeting creation, no database. Just a client mockup.</p>
    <p>But I still think this would fulfill a need that still exists.</p>
