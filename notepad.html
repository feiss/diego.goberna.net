    <h1>Notepad</h1>
    <p class="date">2 Dec, 2023</p>

    <p> Trying to create a simple alternative to <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>
        for my own needs. Also an excuse to learn how to make a web server using <b>Rust</b> with <a
            href="https://crates.io/crates/axum" target="_blank">Axum</a>.
    </p>

    <div style="display:flex;gap:1rem">
        <img class="half" src="res/notepad01.jpg" alt="screenshot">
        <img class="half" src="res/notepad02.jpg" alt="screenshot">
    </div>

    <p>For the client, I used:
    <ul>
        <li>Vanilla html and js</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it" target="_blank">Markdown-it</a> for syntax coloring
            Markdown</li>
        <li><a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a> for syntax coloring code blocks inside Markdown</li>
        <li>For the text editor I didn't like the alternatives I tried (too bloated, hard to tame) and made my basic
            editor using a regular textarea hidden behind a synchronized div for syntax coloring.
            You can alternate between view and edit modes.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>A little "innovation" I tried with this app was to create the idea of different <b>viewers</b> of the same
        document. The only one I made is this, where you could see a calendar and all the lines with a date preceding
        would be
        detected and inserted in the calendar:</p>

    <div style="display:flex;gap:1rem">
        <img class="half" src="res/notepad03.jpg" alt="screenshot">
        <img class="half" src="res/notepad04.jpg" alt="screenshot">
    </div>

    <p>..but the idea was to make more of them. You enter the data in a file and afterwards you can see that
        content through different "smart" viewers that can extract the relevant information for them.
        Another example could be a viewer that take a list of income vs expenses and draws a plot.
    </p>

    <p>I have this project in the "Finished" category because I don't actually use it :P and don't plan to keep working
        on it, but it was usable with a decent amount of basic features.
        But I still think the idea of viewers is quite powerful and interesting.. maybe for a standalone desktop
        app? :/</p>
