    <h1>Pixel art editor(s)</h1>
    <p class="date">Dec 4, 2023</p>

    <p>
        I love pixel art editors. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluxe_Paint" target="_blank">Deluxe Paint</a>
        was the first
        program that hook me for hours and hours, drawing, experimenting, making animations... <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Animator" target="_blank">Autodesk Animator Pro</a> was the
        next one, and
        finally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GrafX2" target="_blank">GrafX2</a>. I'm not sure if I would like
        to know the
        total amount number of hours I spent in these three programs... But I spent a frigging lot.

        Just an example pixel art from 2002
        that I still save, which took me weeks to complete, and was done in a 10'' display of my old <a

        ..and probably the most recent and significant pixel art piece I made is this tileset test from 2014 (omg 10
        years ago??):

        Anyway. Editors. I not only used and tried tons of them, but also love <b>making them</b>. I probably have
        started (not finished ;) ) more than 10 pixel editors to date, and I think I'll be making prototypes for the
        rest of my life.
        They are fun to make, and although the Spanish <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/" target="_blank">Ase
            Sprite</a> is probably a very mature and stablished program, I think there is still room for a lot of
        innovation.

    <p>My lastest attempt was in Rust, using the uber fantastic <a href="https://github.com/emoon/minifb"
            target="_blank">minifb</a> crate by
        <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@daniel_collin" target="_blank">Daniel Collin</a>
