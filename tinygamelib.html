    <h1>Tiny Gamelib</h1>
    <p class="date">Dec 2, 2023</p>

    <p>
        This mini project was about creating the tiniest library I could use for
        small game jams. Very lightweight, simple, for pixelart (palette-based) style.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/feiss/tiny_gamelib" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>
    </p>
    <p>

    <ul>
        <li>Pixel art style with palette indexing</li>
        <li>Basic primitive drawing: pixels, lines, circles, texts, rectangles and images</li>
        <li>Easy keyboard and mouse handling</li>
        <li>Multiple animations per spritesheet (frames, fps, custom anchor position)</li>
        <li>Math utilities: Vector, Rect</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Still barebones, many helpers and good stuff can be added.. but it can be used for tiny and quick
        minigames and experiments with a very low learning curve.
    </p>


    <h2>Farmer Pepe</h2>

    <p>
        The first time I used the library was for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023" target="_blank">GMTK Game
            Jam 2023</a>, in which
        I remade the first level of <b>Mario Bros</b> with a twist. The theme was <b>"Roles Reversed"</b>,
        and the idea was to make the player help the enemies (by feeding them), not kill them.
    </p>

        You can <a href="https://feiss.itch.io/farmer-pepe" target="_blank">play Farmer Pepe at itch.io</a>.

    <p>The game <b>got desqualified</b> for copyright infridgement (surprise!). The fact is that
        I always thought of repainting all the sprites before submitting, but at some point getting
        close to the deadline I had to choose between delivering a playable game with full gameplay
        that would probably be desqualified or a broken game with original sprites.. and I chose the former
        <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code>.
