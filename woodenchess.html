    <h1>Hand-carved chess set</h1>
    <p class="date">Nov 25, 2023</p>
    <p>
        I like wood. I haven't done much with it in the past, but I've always wanted
        to try working with it properly, not just polishing sticks and making kites of cane and paper.
        Two years ago I stumbled across a knife in a store that I thought looked pretty
        cool and I felt prompted to try. An invitation to carve.
    </p>
    <p>
        With that <a href="https://www.opinel.com/en/pocket-knives/carbone/n8-carbon">Opinel #8</a>
        I made a bird and a toy ship, and although the result was very
        clumpsy, the feeling of making those objects out of a piece of wood was really satisfying.

        (Also, making something physical outside the computer screen is great, for a chance).
    </p>

        Some months ago, I got some <b>basswood</b> blocks and started to carve again, and making a chess pawn
        seemed like a quite simple but interesting shape to make. After a couple of failed attempts
        I got a decent piece, and then I made another, and another.. and then a bishop, a horrible knight..
    </p>

    <p>
        For me, the good part of making little pieces like these is that:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                It is a very well-defined miniproject. The shape is known in advance and I don't get
                hooked detailing for hours.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                It takes little time (1 to 1.5 hours per piece), so with a bit of luck I can fit in
                the tiny tiny spare time I have.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                At the end I have a real object that is recognizable and very familiar to everybody,
                that can even provide an little emotional bonding if you are into the game.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    Although I don't play it as much as I'd like nowadays, I've always loved chess,
    so after this point of having 6.5 pieces done (that horse was really, really bad) the idea of making
    the full set become so tempting that I had to give it a try. I'm the opposite of persistent,
    so I kept working acknowledging that I wasn't going to finish it.
    However, due to the three points mentioned earlier, little by little, day by day,
    the number of pieces was increasing over the weeks.

    <p>I quickly realized that I was going to need more tools and materials than just a well sharped knife. I needed:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>A proper carving knife.</b> I realized that the Opinel was too big for the task I was
                doing. And when watching other people carving on YouTube, I saw there were other nice alternatives.
                I got a <a href="https://beavercrafttools.com/products/c2-wood-carving-bench-knife">BeaverCraft C2</a>.
                Sharper than the Opinel, and way more comfortable and adequate to carve. It really makes a difference,
                it allowed me to carve quicker and better, also allowing a new kind of cuts that were much
                harder before. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Protection gloves.</b> Specially for your left/non-dominant hand.
                You can be very confident of your skills, but the chances of getting
                a good cut increase the more time you spent carving. And these knifes
                <b>are really sharp</b>. They saved me from very -very- serious cuts.
                I cannot stress this enough: If you want to carve, get some good gloves.
            </p>
            <p>Also, they give you extra protection when grabbing
                the wood strongly. My hands -not used to hard physical work-
                get sore after a couple of sessions.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Protective tape</b>. Nice to wrap around fingers and add extra
                cushion to the gloves in some parts.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

        The idea of carving a whole chess set was amazing to think about, one of those "naahh that's nuts!"
        but it's fantastic to see that it's almost done, and that it was actually much easier than I thought.

    <h2>Spanish friction to try</h2>
    <p>You know, Spain is the complete opposite of the Silicon Valley mentality.
        With any new project, here the typical reaction is one of rejection, criticism, and opposition:
    <blockquote>
        "It's not worth it, it's too difficult, why bother doing that, it won't work, it's not going to
        succeed..."
    </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
        I had so many of those answers in my life...
    </p>
    <h2>Next steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Redo 3 knights and 1 queen that deserve more love</li>
        <li>Varnish pieces, half of them with dark varnish</li>
        <li>Carve holes in bottoms and stick leads in them, to give them more weight.</li>
        <li>Glue felt on the bottom</li>
        <li>Profiâ€” wait, what about the board?</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
