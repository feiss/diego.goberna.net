    <h1>Hand-carved chess set</h1>

        I like wood. I haven't done much with it in the past, but I've always wanted
        to try working with it more seriously. Two years ago I stumbled across a knife
        in a store that I thought looked pretty cool and was prompting me to try.

    <p>
        An invitation to carve.

    <p>
        With that <a href="https://www.opinel.com/en/pocket-knives/carbone/n8-carbon">Opinel #8</a>
        I made a bird, and a toy ship, and although the result was very
        clumpsy, the feeling of making those objects out of a piece of wood was really satisfying.

        (Also, making something physical outside the computer screen is great, for a chance).

        Some months ago, I got some basswood blocks and started to carve again, and making a chess pawn
        seemed like a quite simple but interesting shape to make. After a couple of failed attempts
        I got a decent piece, and then I made another, and another.. and then a bishop, a horrible knight..

        For me, the good part of making little pieces like these is that:
    <ul>
        <li>It is a very well-defined miniproject. The shape is known in advance and I don't get
            hooked detailing for hours.</li>
        <li>It takes little time (1 to 1.5 hours per piece), so with a bit of luck I can fit in
            the tiny tiny spare time I have.</li>
        <li>At the end I have a real object that is recognizable and very familiar to everybody,
            that can even provide an little emotional bonding if you are into the game.
        </li>
    </ul>

    Although I don't play it as much as I'd like nowadays, I've always loved chess,
    so after this point of having 6.5 pieces done (that horse is really, really bad).
